## Solution Components

* **Genesys Cloud** - A suite of Genesys cloud services for enterprise-grade communications, collaboration, and contact center management. You configure Architect flows, data actions, and outbound campaigns in Genesys Cloud.
* **Architect flow** - A flow in Architect, a drag and drop web-based design tool, dictates how Genesys Cloud handles inbound or outbound interactions.
* **Google Dialogflow** - Dialogflow is a natural language understanding platform that makes it easy to design and integrate a conversational user interface into your mobile app, web application, device, bot, interactive voice response system, and so on. Dialogflow enables you to provide new and engaging ways for users to interact with your product.

## Prerequisites

### Create a virtual agent in Dialogflow
   
1. Create a virtual agent in Dialogflow. For more information, see [Rapidly build and deploy a virtual agent using Dialogflow templates](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/tutorials/covid19-rapid-response "Opens the Rapidly build and deploy a virtual agent using Dialogflow templates in the Dialogflow documentation") in the Dialogflow documentation. The example in the linked procedure shows how to use the ```covid-19-agent-template``` file, which enables you to program chat or voice bots with the latest COVID-19 responses.

   ![Dialogflow Agent](images/dialogflow-agent.png "Rapid response agent in Dialogflow")

:::primary
**Note**: Make a note of the Google Project ID of the virtual agent in Dialogflow. You require this Project ID when you create a service account in Google Cloud.
:::

### Create and manage the service account in Google Cloud
1. Create a service account in the Google Cloud platform. For more information, see [Creating and managing service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts "Opens the Creating and managing service accounts in Google Cloud documentation") in the Google Cloud documentation. Select the Google project created while creating the virtual agent. Ensure that the service account has the Dialogflow API Client and Dialogflow API Admin roles.
![Service account in Google Cloud](images/create-service-account.png "Service account in Google Cloud platform")
2. Create and download the service account key. For more information, see [Creating service account keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys "Opens the Creating service account keys in Google Cloud documentation") in the Google Cloud documentation. Create the key type in JSON format.
