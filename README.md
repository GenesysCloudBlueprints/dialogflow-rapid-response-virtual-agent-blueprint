The voice and chat bot can conduct screenings and answer frequently asked questions about COVID-19. The blueprint demonstrates the use of the COVID-19 virtual agent template, which enables government agencies and healthcare organizations to provide up-to-date information to the public and helps businesses provide critical company-specific information related to COVID-19 to their customers.
